dotfiles
========

My personal collection of dotfiles for macOS & Ubuntu.

Install
=======

Configure system settings (macOS):

```shell
./src/mac-os.zsh
```

Install prerequisites (currently just for Ubuntu):

```shell
./src/bootstrap.sh
```

Install Homebrew:

```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Install the Homebrew packages:

```shell
brew bundle install --file ./src/home/.config/homebrew/Brewfile
```

Install the dotfiles:

> [!NOTE]
> You may want to review your current dotfiles before performing this step to
> ensure that you don't have any settings you'd like to save before they are
> potentially overwritten.

```shell
make install
```

Environment
===========

### Shell

[Z Shell (zsh)](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/) is the primary shell.

- Plugins are managed via [Sheldon](https://sheldon.cli.rs/).
- The prompt utilized is [Starship](https://starship.rs/).
- The following config files are utilized (in order of load):
    1. `~/.zshenv`
    2. `~/.zprofile` (not loaded on Ubuntu)
    3. `~/.zshrc`
    4. `~/.config/zsh/*.zsh`

> [!NOTE]
> After updating your [Sheldon](https://sheldon.cli.rs/) configuration or adding
> new configuration files to `$HOME/.config/zsh` you may need to manually update
> your lockfile via:
>
> ```shell
> sheldon lock
> ```

> [!TIP]
> To manually reload your zsh after configuration changes run the following:
>
> ```shell
> exec zsh
> ```

### Package Manager

Package management is (mostly) handled by [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). On
Ubuntu some packages are managed by `apt` and `snap`.
